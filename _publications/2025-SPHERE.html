This paper introduces SPHERE, a system that enables instructors
to effectively create and review personalized feedback for in-class
coding activities. Comprehensive personalized feedback is crucial
for programming learning. However, providing such feedback in
large programming classrooms poses significant challenges for instructors. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential
assistance, how to efficiently ensure the quality of LLM-generated
feedback remains an open question. SPHERE guides instructors’ attention to critical students’ issues, empowers them with guided control over LLM-generated feedback, and provides visual scaffolding
to facilitate verification of feedback quality. Our between-subject
study with 20 participants demonstrates SPHERE’s effectiveness
in creating more high-quality feedback while not increasing the
time spent on the overall review process compared to a baseline
system. This work contributes a synergistic approach to scaling
personalized feedback in programming education, addressing the
challenges of real-time response, issue prioritization, and largescale personalization.
