Peer instruction (PI) has shown signifcant potential in facilitating
student engagement and collaborative learning. However, the im-
plementation of PI for large-scale programming lectures has proven
challenging due to difculties in monitoring student engagement,
discussion topics, and code changes. This paper introduces VizPI,
an interactive web tool that enables instructors to conduct, mon-
itor, and assess PI for programming exercises in real-time. With
features that visualize the progress of student discussions and code
submissions, VizPI allows for more efective oversight of PI activi-
ties and the provision of personalized feedback at scale. Our work
aims to transform the pedagogical approach to PI in programming
education, making it more engaging and adaptable to student needs.
